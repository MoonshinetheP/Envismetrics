title = {Mechanism, Kinetics and Simulation of Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Dimethylamine Borane (DMAB) on Electroless Gold},
journal = {ECS Meeting Abstracts},
abstract = {Dimethylamine borane ((CH3)2NHBH3) or DMAB, is broadly used as a reducing agent in electroless autocatalytic platings like gold and nickel-boron, hydrogen storage, and reductive amination. However, the mechanism of its DMAB oxidation procedure remains unclear. This project is based on the hypothesis that a multi-step electron transfer mechanism exists for oxidizing the reducing agent DMAB on gold in alkaline media. According to this mechanism, the active species produced when DMAB is used at high hydroxide content is the BH3OH-. This species is created through a series of irreversible electrochemical oxidation producing the following intermediates BH2(OH)2-, BH(OH)3- and B(OH)4-, which is the final product. Multiple electrochemical methods have been used to uncover the properties of DMAB oxidation progress and verify above-mentioned hypothesis. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to test the uncompensated resistance between the working electrode and reference electrode and calibrated in the following experiments: Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that DMAB in hydroxide electrolytes have three half-wave potentials with E_(1/2) of -0.778, -0.174 and 0.248 V. Kinetic current values obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plot decreased with temperature with -4.065, -3.62 and -1.45 mA/cm2 at 25°C, 41°C and 52°C, respectively. Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) and Chronoamperometry (CA) were used to determine the Diffusion Coefficient of BH3(OH)-; BH2(OH)2- and BH(OH)3- 1.38E-05, 3.31E-05 and 1.01E-04, respectively. Tafel analysis was used in obtaining the transfer coefficient, whereas Klingler and Kochi’s method evaluated the constant. These kinetic parameters were used in KISSA-1D software to simulate the CVs. Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to verify the existence of B(OH)4- and a peak at m/z 78.8 was recorded. All of this provided evidence that the three intermediates are involved in the proposed mechanism. In the future, simulated and experimental approaches will be investigated for other amine boranes compounds such as Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(O2CCH3)3), and Sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This work will have far-reaching consequences in enhancing the practical applications of gold and nickel in microelectronics and fuel cells.}

abstract = {We hereby report the development of a novel electrochemical method to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid (C7F15COOH, PFOA). At the center of the approach are bimetallic Pd–Ru nano-catalyst materials called IMPACT: Innovative (nano)Materials and Processes for Advanced Catalytic Technologies. IMPACT uses flavonoid-sequestered Pd–Ru, allowing the development of specialized electrodes with tunable properties to sequentially degrade PFOA in wastewater samples into a sustainable byproduct via an indirect electrochemical method. Electron transfers at RuOxHy species stabilize the Pd component of the nano-catalysts, enabling the degradation process via PFOA deprotonation, chain shortening, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, fluoride elimination, and CF2 flake-off mechanism. IMPACT enabled the observation of redox peaks at −0.26 V and 0.56 V for the first time, with accompanying reduction peaks at −0.5V and 0.29 V, respectively. These redox peaks, which correlated with the concentrations of PFOA (20, 50, 100, 200, and 400. mg L−1), were verified and confirmed using electrochemical simulations. Control experiments did not show degradation of PFOA in the absence of Pd–Ru nano-catalyst. The degradation in wastewater was obtained within 3 h with an efficiency of 98.5%. The electrochemical degradation products of PFOA were identified using High-resolution desalting paper spray mass spectrometry (DPS-MS) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis. The results yielded C2F5COOH, C3F7COOH, and C6F13OH with dissociation losses of CF2O or CO2. IMPACT introduces a novel nano-catalyst with high efficiency and a reliable capability that defluorinates strong C–F bonds that are components of recalcitrant organics in myriad environmental matrices.}

abstract = {The derivation and proposal of major electrochemical techniques used to determine and calculate the electrochemical kinetic parameters is basically based on the electrochemical reaction taking place at liquid/solid or liquid/liquid interface in which all the reactants and products are soluble in liquid aqueous solution or liquid mercury electrode, or are volatile gas. Such electrochemical reaction system is classical and traditional (ERS1). Recently, the electrochemical behavior of some materials used as the active electrode materials in chemical power sources has attracted much attention. In chemical power source systems, either reactant or product, or both are insoluble. This kind of electrochemical reaction system (ERS2) is slightly different from ERS1. The application of these electrochemical techniques/equations to chemical power sources’ system requires carefulness. The misuse of these electrochemical techniques can be easily found in the literatures and some of them even lead to a wrong conclusion. In this review, almost all the electrochemical techniques to measure the exchange current and diffusion coefficient were compiled for reference to the readers, including pulse step, electrochemical impedance, alternating cyclic voltammetry, etc. The necessary requirements/conditions to apply these techniques have been briefly discussed and some simple examples were also discussed for a better understanding.}

The errors of the kinetic parameters evaluated from theoretical CV curves or from those with artificial noise added were calculated and discussed. The subject is important for the modelling of the ECE mechanism and other consecutive reaction steps. The work demonstrates quantitatively the relations that are qualitatively familiar to chemists: a precise determination of second stage kinetic parameters in a consecutive process is impossible if their magnitude is much higher than that in the first stage.}

In particular{,} the system shows “potential inversion” in which the thermodynamic oxidation potential of dopamine to form the corresponding semi-quinone formation occurs at a more positive potential than that of the oxidation of the semi-quinone to the quinone form. The use of Tafel slopes measured from the voltammograms as a function of the voltage scan rate is show to be a particularly sensitive indicator of mechanism showing the effect of the follow-up chemistry in which the two-electron oxidation product undergoes an irreversible cyclization reaction."}

abstract = {Voltammetric waves under five different mass-transport regimes (macroelectrode, microdisc, micro-hemisphere, micro-hemicylinder and single microband) for an irreversible one-electron transfer process were simulated and analysed to find the appropriate Tafel region for accurate analysis. The transfer coefficient was found to deviate significantly from its true value as a function of potential in all cases due to the influence of mass-transport. If and how a simple analytical mass-transport correction in which the current is corrected for the change in the reactant concentration at the surface can be used to improve the measurement of transfer coefficient was investigated. It is shown that this correction is only rigorously valid for a uniformly accessible microelectrode under a true steady-state condition. This translates to hemispherical electrodes only of the set of five considered. The fraction of the current used in Tafel analysis (Tafel region) can be increased to around 50% for quasi-steady state regimes (hemicylindrical and single band electrodes) with this analytical correction but it completely failed in linear diffusion regimes (macroelectrodes). In the latter case an improved empirical correction is suggested.}
