<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

  ```sh
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

pip install flask gunicorn pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy openpyxl matplotlib
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Woffee/Envismetrics.git
   ```
2. Change the workspace to the root path
   ```sh
   cd Envismetrics
   ```
3. Start the service
   ```sh
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
   ```

### Test data

The test data is available in the [Test_Set](https://github.com/Woffee/Envismetrics/tree/main/Test_Set) folder.

## Data Privacy and Retention

When using the online version of Envismetrics, uploaded data is stored temporarily to allow users to revisit their analysis via a unique session link. For example:

`http://34.162.1.1:8080/step_methods/version_0627_040023?step=2`

This link is automatically generated after uploading data and can be bookmarked for future access.

To protect user privacy:
- Uploaded files are **not publicly listed**, and links are sufficiently unique to prevent accidental discovery.
- **All stored data is automatically deleted on the 1st of each month**.
- Currently, there is **no login or authentication system**, as this is an early-stage prototype intended for demonstration and testing purposes.

**Please do not upload sensitive or confidential data at this time.** We plan to introduce access control and permanent storage options in future releases.


## Statement of Need

In terms of data handling, typical electrochemical kinetic analysis solutions have relied on instrument-specific proprietary software provided with potentiostats, homemade scripts for specific data, or manual processing in Excel. Compared with the proprietary tools available from potentiostat manufacturers, these often lack the flexibility, cross-platform support, and comprehensive functionality that Envismetrics offers. Compared with homegrown solutions and packages, Envismetrics provides a more general function that saves time and eliminates the need to re-edit code when changing potentiostats or experimental methods in kinetic analysis. Users can rely on Envismetrics to streamline their workflow and enhance efficiency.

Envismetrics provides an open-source, cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, and Linux) online software focused on electrochemical kinetic analysis. No installation or updates are required, making it convenient and always up-to-date. Envismetrics offers a full toolbox for processing raw voltammogram data, extracting parameters, and generating publication-ready figures. The analysis can be applied to any scan, cycle, or range of voltammogram data. At any stage of the analysis, users can export the results for further use or to create new figures. Whether users are professional researchers seeking to save time or individuals lacking basic knowledge of the relevant equations, Envismetrics encourages reproducible, easy-to-use, and transparent analysis.

Envismetrics not only facilitates data collection and analysis from electrochemical experiments but also provides educational resources to help users understand the terminology and concepts they encounter. This dual approach ensures that both seasoned researchers and newcomers can effectively utilize the software.

Envismetrics is dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation. Future plans include incorporating widely used kinetic electrochemical analysis methods and expanding support for additional data formats from various potentiostat brands. The software's modular design enables the seamless integration of new features and methods, ensuring Envismetrics remains a leading tool in electrochemical analysis.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap


### Hydrodynamic Voltammetry (HDV) Module

1. Data Import, Plotting, and Gaussian Filtering
    - Data Import: Supports importing data from various potentiostats and file formats.
    - Plotting: Visualizes the imported data sorted by RPM (rotations per minute).
    - Gaussian Filtering: Applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the plotted data.
2. Levich and Koutecky-Levich Analysis
	- Levich Plot and Analysis:
		- Generates Levich plots directly from the data.
		- Calculates the diffusion coefficient from the slope of the plot.
	- Koutecky-Levich Plot and Analysis:
		- Produces Koutecky-Levich plots.
