abstract = {1,4-Dioxane, a potential human carcinogen, poses significant environmental challenges as a contaminant in water resources, and the efficient degradation of this compound is crucial for successfully optimizing its electrochemical removal. For the prediction and enhancement of degradation efficiency, a precise identification of kinetic parameters, reaction conditions, and degradation products, along with an understanding of the mechanisms involved, is required. But, most of these parameters are often not provided in the current literature. This study investigates the electrochemical behavior and reaction mechanism of 1,4-Dioxane using palladium‑ruthenium bimetallic nanocatalysts on glassy carbon electrodes by both experimental and simulation analyses. The characterization of fabricated nanocatalyst was carried out using STEM-EDX and UV–visible spectroscopy. The electrochemical features and redox reaction mechanism of 1,4-dioxane were systematically explained through the quantification of the half-wave potential (E1/2), diffusion coefficient (D), rate constant (k), transfer coefficient (α), and charge transfer resistance (Rct), utilizing cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), rotating disk electrode - hydrodynamic voltammetry (RDE-HDV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Simulations conducted with the KISSA1D software yielded convincing findings that align with the experimental results, confirming the accuracy of the modeling and underlining the reliability of the experimental methodology. In addition, the final reduction of 1,4-dioxane to carbon dioxide and water was revealed by LC-MS analysis. This research improves our understanding of the kinetic behaviors and underlying mechanisms in redox reactions and fills the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in electrochemistry, and environmental chemistry.}

abstract = {Diverse systems of technologic and scientific relevance involve a surface-confined diffusional problem coupled to a charge transfer reaction and depend on similar boundary conditions. A general mathematical solution for describing electrochemical responses associated with the diffusion of electroactive species into a host thin-film (TF) material is presented. In this manuscript, the mathematical solutions correspond to chronoamperometric profiles of electrodes modified with a TF where the electroactive species have different permeability and reversibility of the charge transfer reaction. In chronoamperometric measurements, the film permeability (or the partition constant) affects the ratio between the values of current measured at long and short times of a Cottrell plot. Besides, the ratio between the film thickness and the diffusion coefficient of species inside the film affects the time when the TF behavior can be observed. The model is used to optimize the fit of chronoamperometric profiles corresponding to the oxidation of FcMeOH at a GCE modified with a hydrophobic TF. The charge transfer rate found is slower than expected, probably because the ionic exchange at the TF-aqueous solution interface would delay the electron transfer process.}

abstract = {The mathematical models that are typically employed for describing the responses of chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of guest species that diffuse into an impermeable host material have been adapted for the case of an electrode covered with an organic thin film (TF). The mathematical solution has been used for simulating and fitting the electrochemical responses of ferrocene-methanol (FcMeOH) on the surface of a working electrode modified with a TF of highly plasticized polyvinyl chloride. The analysis of chronoamperometric profiles allows us to determine the diffusion coefficient and the concentration of the electroactive species in the TF. Also, from those values is possible to estimate values for the partition coefficient of FcMeOH between an aqueous solution and an organic film, as well as for the film thickness. The EIS responses exhibited remarkable consistency with the CA results. In the high frequency range, the TF system displayed a Warburg-type behavior, while at low frequencies, Nyquist's plot revealed a pronounced capacitive behavior due to the limited insertion of FcMeOH. The fit of CA and EIS responses yielded a set of resistance and capacitance values from which it is possible to infer that the diffusion resistance is significantly larger than the charge transfer resistance and that there are no trapping sites that could be associated with imperfections in the lattice of PVC. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where a model developed for the electrochemistry of insertion has been adapted to elucidate the partitioning of redox species between two immiscible liquids, followed by a charge transfer electrode process.}

Cyclic voltammograms were characterized by a well-defined one-electron reversible redox couple in both media at low scan rates. The reduced form of TEMPO+ is catalytically regenerated in a follow-up chemical reaction with benzyl alcohol (BA) in the presence of 2,6-lutidine. It was observed that in [BMIm][PF6], the redox currents are largely suppressed compared to that in CH3CN. The apparent heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (kapp0) of the quasi-reversible redox reaction of TEMPO was determined at a Pt electrode and found to be 1.9×10−3cms−1 and 4.5×10−2cms−1 in [BMIm][PF6] and CH3CN, respectively. With the aid of chronoamperometry (CA), the homogeneous rate constant for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by TEMPO, in the presence of 2,6-lutidine in CH3CN was estimated to be 5.53×101M−1s−1 which is approximately double, relative to the value of 2.91×101M−1s−1 determined in [BMIm][PF6].}

The diffusion coefficient (D) for lithium ion intercalation into the WO3 film, calculated from the Randles–Sevcik equation has been compared to that calculated by the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT), carried out on the same WO3 film. It has been found that at high scan rates (above 2 mV/s) the Randles–Sevcik method tends to grossly overestimate diffusion coefficient, possibly due to the occurrence of large potential gradients within the WO3 film. Compared to the results deduced from GITT, the voltammetric diffusion coefficient was found to be up to 67% higher. It can therefore be concluded that diffusion coefficient values deduced by CV peaks with use of the Randles–Sevcik method must be treated with caution and that low scan rates (2 mV/s or below) are required for credible results.}

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, the battery is the primary power source for electrifying the transition of the transport sector and bridging the gap in renewable energy intermittency. Furthermore, optimizing the electrochemical performance of the battery prevents its chemical aging, which can be verified by tuning the kinetic and diffusion parameters of the electrodes and electrolyte/electrode interface. This work focuses on predicting the diffusion parameters of metal batteries that are currently not experimentally realized in laboratory conditions. First, diffusion equations are used to analyze the relation between the diffusion coefficient and Warburg factor for the monovalent and multivalent metal ion batteries to predict the theoretical values of the diffusion coefficient at different temperatures. Second, the relationship between the charge transfer resistance and the Warburg factor is modeled to predict speculative behavior and calculate the fitting parameters. Finally, the modeled Randles-Sevcik equation indicated the relationship between peak current and the scan rate at different diffusion coefficients. Compared to the existing algorithms available for battery modeling, this research is the first of its kind.}

title = {Mechanism, Kinetics and Simulation of Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Dimethylamine Borane (DMAB) on Electroless Gold},
journal = {ECS Meeting Abstracts},
abstract = {Dimethylamine borane ((CH3)2NHBH3) or DMAB, is broadly used as a reducing agent in electroless autocatalytic platings like gold and nickel-boron, hydrogen storage, and reductive amination. However, the mechanism of its DMAB oxidation procedure remains unclear. This project is based on the hypothesis that a multi-step electron transfer mechanism exists for oxidizing the reducing agent DMAB on gold in alkaline media. According to this mechanism, the active species produced when DMAB is used at high hydroxide content is the BH3OH-. This species is created through a series of irreversible electrochemical oxidation producing the following intermediates BH2(OH)2-, BH(OH)3- and B(OH)4-, which is the final product. Multiple electrochemical methods have been used to uncover the properties of DMAB oxidation progress and verify above-mentioned hypothesis. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to test the uncompensated resistance between the working electrode and reference electrode and calibrated in the following experiments: Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that DMAB in hydroxide electrolytes have three half-wave potentials with E_(1/2) of -0.778, -0.174 and 0.248 V. Kinetic current values obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plot decreased with temperature with -4.065, -3.62 and -1.45 mA/cm2 at 25°C, 41°C and 52°C, respectively. Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) and Chronoamperometry (CA) were used to determine the Diffusion Coefficient of BH3(OH)-; BH2(OH)2- and BH(OH)3- 1.38E-05, 3.31E-05 and 1.01E-04, respectively. Tafel analysis was used in obtaining the transfer coefficient, whereas Klingler and Kochi’s method evaluated the constant. These kinetic parameters were used in KISSA-1D software to simulate the CVs. Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to verify the existence of B(OH)4- and a peak at m/z 78.8 was recorded. All of this provided evidence that the three intermediates are involved in the proposed mechanism. In the future, simulated and experimental approaches will be investigated for other amine boranes compounds such as Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(O2CCH3)3), and Sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This work will have far-reaching consequences in enhancing the practical applications of gold and nickel in microelectronics and fuel cells.}

At the center of the approach are bimetallic Pd–Ru nano-catalyst materials called IMPACT: Innovative (nano)Materials and Processes for Advanced Catalytic Technologies. IMPACT uses flavonoid-sequestered Pd–Ru, allowing the development of specialized electrodes with tunable properties to sequentially degrade PFOA in wastewater samples into a sustainable byproduct via an indirect electrochemical method. Electron transfers at RuOxHy species stabilize the Pd component of the nano-catalysts, enabling the degradation process via PFOA deprotonation, chain shortening, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, fluoride elimination, and CF2 flake-off mechanism. IMPACT enabled the observation of redox peaks at −0.26 V and 0.56 V for the first time, with accompanying reduction peaks at −0.5V and 0.29 V, respectively. These redox peaks, which correlated with the concentrations of PFOA (20, 50, 100, 200, and 400. mg L−1), were verified and confirmed using electrochemical simulations. Control experiments did not show degradation of PFOA in the absence of Pd–Ru nano-catalyst. The degradation in wastewater was obtained within 3 h with an efficiency of 98.5%. The electrochemical degradation products of PFOA were identified using High-resolution desalting paper spray mass spectrometry (DPS-MS) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis. The results yielded C2F5COOH, C3F7COOH, and C6F13OH with dissociation losses of CF2O or CO2. IMPACT introduces a novel nano-catalyst with high efficiency and a reliable capability that defluorinates strong C–F bonds that are components of recalcitrant organics in myriad environmental matrices.}

Recently, the electrochemical behavior of some materials used as the active electrode materials in chemical power sources has attracted much attention. In chemical power source systems, either reactant or product, or both are insoluble. This kind of electrochemical reaction system (ERS2) is slightly different from ERS1. The application of these electrochemical techniques/equations to chemical power sources’ system requires carefulness. The misuse of these electrochemical techniques can be easily found in the literatures and some of them even lead to a wrong conclusion. In this review, almost all the electrochemical techniques to measure the exchange current and diffusion coefficient were compiled for reference to the readers, including pulse step, electrochemical impedance, alternating cyclic voltammetry, etc. The necessary requirements/conditions to apply these techniques have been briefly discussed and some simple examples were also discussed for a better understanding.}

abstract = {Voltammetric waves under five different mass-transport regimes (macroelectrode, microdisc, micro-hemisphere, micro-hemicylinder and single microband) for an irreversible one-electron transfer process were simulated and analysed to find the appropriate Tafel region for accurate analysis. The transfer coefficient was found to deviate significantly from its true value as a function of potential in all cases due to the influence of mass-transport. If and how a simple analytical mass-transport correction in which the current is corrected for the change in the reactant concentration at the surface can be used to improve the measurement of transfer coefficient was investigated. It is shown that this correction is only rigorously valid for a uniformly accessible microelectrode under a true steady-state condition. This translates to hemispherical electrodes only of the set of five considered. The fraction of the current used in Tafel analysis (Tafel region) can be increased to around 50% for quasi-steady state regimes (hemicylindrical and single band electrodes) with this analytical correction but it completely failed in linear diffusion regimes (macroelectrodes). In the latter case an improved empirical correction is suggested.}
