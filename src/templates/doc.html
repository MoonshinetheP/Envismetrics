<h1 id="section_range">Applied Potential Range (for HDV)</h1>

<p>In <strong>Hydrodynamic Voltammetry (HDV)</strong> analysis, not every part of the hydrodynamic voltammogram is
    suitable for <strong>Levich</strong> and <strong>Koutecky-Levich</strong> analysis. These analyses work best when
    the current exhibits a distinct plateau region, indicating that mass transport limitations have been reached.</p>

<p>The <em>Applied Potential Range (for HDV)</em> feature allows users to perform Levich and Koutecky-Levich analyses
    within a specific potential range. For example, setting the range to <code>(-1, 1)</code> means the analysis will
    focus on the potential window between <code>-1V</code> and <code>1V</code>.</p>

<p>By defining this potential range, users can exclude sections of the voltammogram that are not suitable for analysis,
    ensuring more accurate and reliable results.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Using the Applied Potential Range:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Defining the Range</strong>: Users can input a potential range either through the software interface or
        via the command line. For example, <code>(-1, 1)</code> means that the analysis will focus on the potential from
        <code>-1V</code> to <code>1V</code>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>How to Choose the Range</strong>: Typically, you should select a range where the current shows a stable
        plateau, avoiding areas with large fluctuations. This helps ensure the accuracy of the analysis and clearer
        Levich and Koutecky-Levich plots.
    </li>
</ul>


<h1 id="section6">Chronoamperometry</h1>

<h2>What is Chronoamperometry?</h2>
<p><strong>Chronoamperometry</strong> is an electrochemical technique where a constant potential is applied to an
    electrode, and the resulting current is measured as a function of time. This technique is used to study the kinetics
    of electrochemical reactions, diffusion processes, and the stability of electrode materials.</p>

<h2>Principle of Chronoamperometry</h2>
<p>In chronoamperometry, a potential step is applied to the working electrode, and the resulting current decay is
    monitored. The initial current spike is due to the rapid charging of the electrical double layer and the immediate
    electrochemical reaction. Over time, the current decreases as the concentration of the electroactive species near
    the electrode surface is depleted and diffusion controls the rate of the reaction.</p>

<h3>Equation</h3>
<p>The current response in chronoamperometry for a diffusion-controlled process is described by the Cottrell
    equation:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ i(t) = \frac{nFAC^* D^{1/2}}{\pi^{1/2} t^{1/2}} $$
</div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>i(t)</strong> = Current at time t (A)</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of electrons transferred in the reaction</li>
    <li><strong>F</strong> = Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> = Electrode area (cm²)</li>
    <li><strong>C<sup>*</sup></strong> = Bulk concentration of the electroactive species (mol/cm³)</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong> = Diffusion coefficient (cm²/s)</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> = Time (s)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage of Chronoamperometry</h2>
<p>Chronoamperometry is used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diffusion Coefficients</strong>: To measure the diffusion coefficients of electroactive species.</li>
    <li><strong>Material Characterization</strong>: To study the stability and performance of electrode materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrodeposition</strong>: To control the thickness and uniformity of electroplated films.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 id="section_cycle_number">Cycle number to display:</h1>
    <p>This setting allows you to choose which cycle number to display in the output.</p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <p>Electrochemical experiments often involve multiple cycles of data collection, especially in cyclic voltammetry. The <strong>cycle number</strong> refers to which of these data collection cycles is displayed. For instance, if you select <strong>cycle 9</strong>, the system will show the data from the 9th cycle.</p>


<h1 id="section_cycle">Cycle Range Parameter</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cycle Range</strong> parameter specifies the range of cycles (or scan numbers) that the software will
    analyze in a cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment. This parameter allows you to focus on a specific subset of the
    overall data, excluding the initial or final cycles that may not represent the steady-state behavior of the system.
</p>

<h2>How to Set?</h2>
<p>You can set this parameter by defining the starting and ending cycle numbers that you want to include in the
    analysis. This is particularly useful when the initial cycles may contain artifacts or the final cycles may show
    signs of degradation or instability.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you want to analyze cycles 2 through 15, you would set the Cycle Range as <code>range(2,
    16)</code>. This means the software will analyze from the second cycle up to, but not including, the 16th cycle (so
    cycles 2 to 15).</p>

<p>This flexibility allows you to tailor the analysis to the specific regions of the data that are most relevant to your
    research objectives, ensuring that the analysis is focused and accurate.</p>

<h1 id="section_discard">Discard Scan Rate Parameters</h1>

<h2>What It Is?</h2>
<p>The <strong>"Discard scan rate from"</strong> and <strong>"Discard scan rate after"</strong> parameters allow you to
    exclude specific scans from the beginning and end of your dataset before conducting analysis. These parameters are
    particularly useful in ensuring that your analysis focuses only on the most relevant and accurate data, avoiding any
    potential artifacts or inconsistencies in the initial and final scans.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Discard scan rate from:</strong> This parameter specifies the number of scans to discard from the start
        of the dataset.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Discard scan rate after:</strong> This parameter specifies the number of scans to discard from the end
        of the dataset.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Set?</h2>
<p>You can set these parameters based on your experimental needs, such as the behavior of the peaks and the conditions
    under which the scans were obtained.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Your dataset:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>CV_data_10mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_20mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_50mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_100mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_150mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_200mVs</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Settings:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discard scan rate from:</strong> [(1)]</li>
            <li><strong>Discard scan rate after:</strong> [(1)]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Resulting Dataset After Discarding:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>CV_data_20mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_50mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_100mVs</li>
            <li>CV_data_150mVs</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Analyzing Multiple Peaks:</h2>
<p>If your analysis involves multiple peaks, you can set the <strong>"Discard scan rate from"</strong> and <strong>"Discard
    scan rate after"</strong> parameters individually for each peak (for example: Discard scan rate from [(1, 0, 1)],
    Discard scan rate after [(1, 1, 0)]). This indicates that you have three peaks to analyze. For peak 1: Analysis
    includes scans between the first and last, excluding those two. For peak 2: Analysis includes all scans except the
    last one. For peak 3: Analysis includes all scans except the first one.</p>

<p>This allows you to discard the scans that might interfere with the accurate identification of specific peaks. For
    instance, one peak might require excluding certain low scan rates to prevent overlap with another peak, while
    another peak might benefit from a different range of scan rates.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters?</h2>
<p>As the scan rate changes, the current peaks in your dataset may shift, causing them to merge with other peaks or
    become less visible. This can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. By carefully selecting which scans to
    include in your analysis—specifically by discarding the initial and final scans that might introduce errors—you can
    ensure that each peak remains distinct and that your analysis is more accurate.</p>

<p>When analyzing multiple peaks, adjusting the scan rates for each peak helps prevent overlap, ensuring that each peak
    is analyzed within the most appropriate range. This improves the precision of your results and leads to more
    reliable conclusions in your study.</p>

<h1 id="section11">Diffusion Coefficient (D)</h1>

<h2>What is the Diffusion Coefficient?</h2>
<p>The <strong>diffusion coefficient</strong>, denoted as \(D\), is a measure of the rate at which particles or
    molecules spread out or diffuse through a medium. It is typically expressed in units of square centimeters per
    second (cm²/s) or square meters per second (m²/s). The diffusion coefficient is an important parameter in describing
    the kinetics of diffusion-controlled processes.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider a solute with a diffusion coefficient of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) cm²/s in a solution. This means that, on
    average, the solute molecules will diffuse through the solvent at a rate of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) square centimeters
    per second. The higher the diffusion coefficient, the faster the molecules move through the medium.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The diffusion coefficient (\(D\)) is used in various contexts, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fick's Laws of Diffusion</strong>: To describe the flux and concentration gradients in a system.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrochemical Analysis</strong>: To determine the rate of mass transport in electrochemical cells.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Material Science</strong>: To study the diffusion of atoms and molecules in solids and liquids.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Science</strong>: To model the dispersion of pollutants in air, water, and soil.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section8">Initial Concentration (C<sub>0</sub>)</h1>

<h2>What is Initial Concentration?</h2>
<p>The <strong>initial concentration</strong>, denoted as \(C_0\), refers to the concentration of a substance in a
    solution at the beginning of an experiment or reaction. It is typically measured in moles per cubic centimeter
    (mol/cm³) or moles per liter (M).</p>

<h1 id="section3">Kinematic Viscosity</h1>

<h2>What is Kinematic Viscosity?</h2>
<p>Kinematic viscosity (\(\nu\)) is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow under the influence of gravity. It is
    defined as the ratio of the dynamic viscosity (\(\mu\)) to the density (\(\rho\)) of the fluid. Kinematic viscosity
    is typically expressed in units of square meters per second (m²/s) or Stokes (St), where 1 St = \(10^{-4}\)
    m²/s.</p>

<h2>Equation</h2>
<p>The kinematic viscosity (\(\nu\)) can be calculated using the following equation:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ \nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} $$
</div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\nu\) = Kinematic viscosity (m²/s)</li>
    <li>\(\mu\) = Dynamic viscosity (Pa·s or kg/(m·s))</li>
    <li>\(\rho\) = Density of the fluid (kg/m³)</li>
</ul>

    <h1 id="section1">Levich and Koutecky-Levich Analysis</h1>

    <h2>What is Levich Analysis?</h2>
    <p><strong>Levich Equation</strong>: The Levich equation describes the relationship between the limiting current and
        the rotation speed of a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in an electrochemical cell. It is used to determine the
        diffusion coefficient of the reacting species and the kinetics of the reaction.</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$ I_L = 0.62 n F A D^{2/3} \nu^{-1/6} \omega^{1/2} C $$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I<sub>L</sub></strong> = Limiting current (A)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of electrons transferred in the reaction</li>
        <li><strong>F</strong> = Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong> = Electrode area (cm²)</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong> = Diffusion coefficient (cm²/s)</li>
        <li><strong>ν</strong> = Kinematic viscosity of the solution (cm²/s)</li>
        <li><strong>ω</strong> = Angular rotation speed (rad/s)</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong> = Concentration of the reactant (mol/cm³)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Determining Diffusion Coefficient:</strong> By measuring the limiting current at different rotation
            speeds, the diffusion coefficient \(D\) can be calculated.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Understanding Mass Transport:</strong> It provides insights into how mass transport influences the
            overall reaction rate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>If you have a series of limiting current values measured at different rotation speeds, you can plot \(I_L\)
        versus \(\omega^{1/2}\). The slope of the resulting line can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of
        the reactant.</p>

    <h2>What is Koutecky-Levich Analysis?</h2>
    <p><strong>Koutecky-Levich Equation</strong>: The Koutecky-Levich equation combines the kinetics of the electron
        transfer process with the mass transport limitation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the reaction
        mechanism.</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$ \frac{1}{I} = \frac{1}{I_k} + \frac{1}{I_L} $$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I</strong> = Measured current (A)</li>
        <li><strong>I<sub>k</sub></strong> = Kinetic current (A)</li>
        <li><strong>I<sub>L</sub></strong> = Levich (diffusion-limited) current (A)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The kinetic current \(I_k\) is given by:</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$ I_k = n F k A C $$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>k</strong> = Rate constant of the reaction (cm/s)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Separating Kinetic and Diffusion Effects:</strong> By measuring the current at different rotation
            speeds and applying the Koutecky-Levich equation, the kinetic current \(I_k\) can be separated from the
            diffusion-limited current \(I_L\).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Determining Kinetic Parameters:</strong> It helps in determining the rate constant \(k\) and
            understanding the intrinsic kinetics of the electrochemical reaction.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>If you plot \(\frac{1}{I}\) versus \(\frac{1}{\omega^{1/2}}\), you will get a straight line. The intercept gives
        \(\frac{1}{I_k}\) (the inverse of the kinetic current), and the slope provides \(\frac{1}{I_L}\) (the inverse of
        the Levich current).</p>

    <h2>How to Use Levich and Koutecky-Levich Analysis</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Perform RDE Experiments:</strong> Conduct experiments at various rotation speeds to measure the
            limiting current \(I_L\).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Plot Levich Plot:</strong> Plot the limiting current \(I_L\) against the square root of the rotation
            speed \(\omega^{1/2}\).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Determine Diffusion Coefficient:</strong> From the slope of the Levich plot, calculate the diffusion
            coefficient \(D\).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Apply Koutecky-Levich Equation:</strong> Use the Koutecky-Levich equation to separate the kinetic
            and diffusion contributions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Plot Koutecky-Levich Plot:</strong> Plot \(\frac{1}{I}\) versus \(\frac{1}{\omega^{1/2}}\) to
            determine the kinetic current \(I_k\) and the rate constant \(k\).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples in Practice</h2>

    <h3>Levich Analysis Example:</h3>
    <p>Suppose you measure the limiting current \(I_L\) at different rotation speeds:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\(\omega_1 = 100\) rad/s, \(I_{L1} = 0.5\) A</li>
        <li>\(\omega_2 = 400\) rad/s, \(I_{L2} = 1.0\) A</li>
        <li>\(\omega_3 = 900\) rad/s, \(I_{L3} = 1.5\) A</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plotting \(I_L\) versus \(\omega^{1/2}\) gives a straight line. From the slope, you can calculate the diffusion
        coefficient \(D\).</p>

    <h3>Koutecky-Levich Analysis Example:</h3>
    <p>Using the same data, plot \(\frac{1}{I}\) versus \(\frac{1}{\omega^{1/2}}\). The intercept gives
        \(\frac{1}{I_k}\), and the slope provides \(\frac{1}{I_L}\). From this plot, you can determine the kinetic
        parameters of the reaction.</p>

    <p>By combining these analyses, you gain a deeper understanding of both the mass transport and kinetic aspects of
        your electrochemical reaction.</p>

<h1 id="section7">Number of Electron Transfer (n)</h1>

<h2>What is the Number of Electron Transfer?</h2>
<p>The <strong>number of electron transfer</strong>, denoted as \(n\), refers to the number of electrons involved in an
    electrochemical reaction. It is a key parameter in determining the stoichiometry of the reaction and is used in
    various electrochemical equations to describe the process.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In the reduction of copper ions:</p>
<div class="equation">
    $$ \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} $$
</div>
<p>\(n = 2\), indicating that two electrons are involved in the reduction of one copper ion.</p>

<h1 id="section_potentials">Number of Potentials to Show (for HDV)</h1>

<p>The <strong>Number of Potentials to Show</strong> setting allows users to define how many potential values within the
    selected potential range will be used for Levich and Koutecky-Levich regression. This feature ensures that users can
    focus on a manageable subset of data points for analysis.</p>

<p>After selecting the applied potential range, users can specify the number of potentials they wish to include in the
    analysis. By adjusting this parameter, users can balance between obtaining detailed regression results and avoiding
    overloading the analysis with unnecessary data points.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Using Number of Potentials to Show:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Defining the Number of Potentials:</strong> Users can input the number of potentials to analyze within
        the selected range. For example, setting this value to 5 will select 5 potentials evenly spaced within the
        defined potential range for analysis.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Choosing the Right Number:</strong> The number of potentials should be chosen based on the desired
        resolution of the regression. A smaller number of potentials might provide a simpler and faster analysis, while
        a larger number might offer more precision.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>By controlling the number of potentials to show, users can fine-tune the balance between simplicity and precision in
    their Levich and Koutecky-Levich analysis.</p>

<h1 id="section12">Peak Range Parameters (for CV peak searching)</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Peak Range (Top):</strong> This parameter specifies the potential (voltage) ranges in the cyclic
        voltammogram where the software will search for peaks in the upper (positive) direction. Each pair of numbers
        represents a range of applied potentials (in volts) where a peak might occur in the positive direction.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Peak Range (Bottom):</strong> This parameter is similar to the "Peak Range (Top)," but it specifies the
        potential ranges where the software will search for peaks in the lower (negative) direction. Each pair
        represents a range of potentials in the negative direction.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to set?</h2>
<p>You set these parameters by defining the potential ranges where you expect peaks to occur. When searching for peaks,
    it's crucial that the "Peak Range (Top)" and "Peak Range (Bottom)" parameters have the same number of pairs. This
    ensures that the software can correctly align and analyze peaks across both the positive and negative
    directions.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Single Peak Search:</strong> <code>[($value_{i}$, $value_{f}$)]</code><br>
        If you want to search for just one peak, input a single pair of values specifying the potential range for both
        "Top" and "Bottom."
    </li>

    <li><strong>Multiple Peak Search:</strong> <code>[($value_{1i}$, $value_{1f}$), \dots, ($value_{ni}$,
        $value_{nf}$)]</code><br>
        If you expect to find multiple peaks, input multiple pairs of values, ensuring that the "Top" and "Bottom"
        parameters have the same length.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Single Peak Search:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're only interested in finding a peak between 0 V and 0.2 V in the positive direction, you would
                set the "Peak Range (Top)" as <code>(0, 0.2)</code> and the "Peak Range (Bottom)" similarly, say, <code>(0,
                    -0.2)</code> if you expect a corresponding negative peak.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Multiple Peak Search:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Suppose you expect to find peaks within the ranges of -1 V to -0.70 V, 0 V to 0.2 V, and 0.25 V to 0.5
                V. You would set the parameters as follows:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Peak Range (Bottom):</strong> <code>(-1, -0.70)</code>, <code>(0, -0.2)</code>, <code>(0.25,
                    -0.5)</code></li>
                <li><strong>Peak Range (Top):</strong> <code>(-1, 0.70)</code>, <code>(0, 0.2)</code>, <code>(0.25,
                    0.5)</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>By setting these ranges, the software will search for peaks within the specified voltage ranges in both the positive
    and negative directions, providing you with a comprehensive analysis of your cyclic voltammogram data.</p>

<h1 id="section_potential_step">Potential Step</h1>

<p>In a typical hydrodynamic voltammogram, you may have thousands of potential points (e.g., over 10,000 potentials) and
    their corresponding response currents. Calculating the slope for each potential during Levich and Koutecky-Levich
    analysis could be time-consuming, even for a computer. To address this issue, the <strong>Potential Step</strong>
    feature allows users to skip certain potentials and calculate the slope only at every nth potential, as defined by
    the user.</p>

<p>This feature optimizes the analysis process by reducing the computational load while still providing meaningful
    results.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Using Potential Step:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Defining the Potential Step:</strong> Users can input a value to define how many potentials to skip
        between slope calculations. For example, setting this value to 100 will calculate the slope for every 100th
        potential.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Choosing the Right Step Size:</strong> The step size should be chosen based on the trade-off between
        speed and accuracy. A smaller step size (e.g., 1 or 2) will give more detailed results but take longer, while a
        larger step size will speed up the analysis but provide fewer data points.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>By using the <strong>Potential Step</strong> feature, users can streamline their analysis without sacrificing too
    much accuracy, especially when dealing with large datasets.</p>

<h1 id="section4">Randles–Ševčík Analysis</h1>

<h2>What is Randles–Ševčík Analysis?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Randles–Ševčík analysis</strong> is a method used in electrochemistry to analyze cyclic voltammetry data.
    It relates the peak current observed in a cyclic voltammogram to the scan rate, the concentration of the
    electroactive species, and the diffusion coefficient. This analysis is particularly useful for reversible
    electrochemical reactions.</p>

<h2>Equation</h2>
<p>The Randles–Ševčík equation for a reversible reaction at 25°C is given by:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ i_p = (2.69 \times 10^5) \, n^{3/2} \, A \, D^{1/2} \, C \, \nu^{1/2} $$
</div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>i<sub>p</sub></strong> = Peak current (A)</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of electrons transferred in the redox event</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> = Electrode area (cm²)</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong> = Diffusion coefficient (cm²/s)</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> = Concentration of the electroactive species (mol/cm³)</li>
    <li><strong>ν</strong> = Scan rate (V/s)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage of Randles–Ševčík Analysis</h2>
<p>Randles–Ševčík analysis is commonly used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species.</li>
    <li>Analyze the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction.</li>
    <li>Investigate the reversibility of the electrochemical process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Randles–Ševčík Analysis</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Perform Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) Experiments:</strong> Conduct CV experiments at various scan rates (ν)
        to measure the peak current (i<sub>p</sub>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Plot Peak Current vs. Scan Rate:</strong> Plot the peak current (i<sub>p</sub>) against the square root
        of the scan rate (ν<sup>1/2</sup>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Determine Diffusion Coefficient:</strong> The slope of the resulting linear plot can be used to
        determine the diffusion coefficient (D) using the Randles–Ševčík equation.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Example in Practice</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you perform CV experiments for a redox couple with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>n = 1 (one-electron transfer)</li>
    <li>A = 0.1 cm² (electrode area)</li>
    <li>C = 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mol/cm³ (concentration)</li>
    <li>ν = 0.01 to 0.1 V/s (scan rate range)</li>
</ul>

<p>By plotting the peak current (i<sub>p</sub>) versus the square root of the scan rate (ν<sup>1/2</sup>), you obtain a
    straight line. The slope of this line (s) is related to the diffusion coefficient (D) by the Randles–Ševčík
    equation:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ s = 2.69 \times 10^5 \, n^{3/2} \, A \, D^{1/2} \, C $$
</div>

<p>From the slope, you can solve for the diffusion coefficient D.</p>

<h1 id="section10">Rate Constant (k)</h1>

<h2>What is the Rate Constant?</h2>
<p>The <strong>rate constant</strong>, denoted as \(k\), is a proportionality constant in the rate equation of a
    chemical reaction. It provides a measure of the speed at which a reaction occurs. The rate constant is specific to a
    given reaction at a particular temperature and is typically determined experimentally.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>For a first-order reaction:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ \text{Rate} = k[A] $$
</div>

<p>where [A] is the concentration of the reactant. The rate constant \(k\) has units of s\(^{-1}\).</p>

<p>For a second-order reaction:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ \text{Rate} = k[A][B] $$
</div>

<p>where [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants. The rate constant \(k\) has units of
    M\(^{-1}\)s\(^{-1}\).</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The rate constant (\(k\)) is used in various contexts, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Determining Reaction Rates:</strong> To calculate the speed of a reaction based on reactant concentrations.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparing Reactions:</strong> To compare the reactivity of different reactions under similar conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Kinetic Studies:</strong> To analyze the effect of different parameters, such as temperature and catalysts, on the reaction rate.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 id="section_regression">Regression Time Range</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Regression Time Range</strong> in the chronoamperometry module specifies the portion of the experimental data that will be used for linear regression analysis. In electrochemical experiments, the current response changes over time, and the <strong>Regression Time Range</strong> allows users to focus on a specific period where the current behavior is most suitable for extracting kinetic parameters like the diffusion coefficient.</p>

    <p>By selecting an appropriate range of the term
    <span class="equation">\(\frac{nFAC_0}{\sqrt{\pi} t^{1/2}}\)</span>, you ensure that only the relevant part of the data is considered, improving the accuracy of the regression analysis.</p>

    <h2>How to Use It</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Format:</strong>
            <p>The <strong>Regression Time Range</strong> is typically input as a two-element array or tuple, such as \([start, end]\), where both <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> refer to the values of the term
            <span class="equation">\(\frac{nFAC_0}{\sqrt{\pi} t^{1/2}}\)</span>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <span class="equation">\([0, 1]\)</span> would select the range of
                <span class="equation">\(\frac{nFAC_0}{\sqrt{\pi} t^{1/2}}\)</span> from 0 to 1 for the regression analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choosing an Appropriate Range:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial transient:</strong> The initial period (right after applying the potential step) often shows rapid changes in current due to charging of the double layer and other non-steady-state processes. For kinetic analysis, the range corresponding to this initial transient might not be ideal. You can choose a starting value of
                <span class="equation">\(\frac{nFAC_0}{\sqrt{\pi} t^{1/2}}\)</span> that excludes this initial transient.</li>
                <li><strong>Steady-state:</strong> Selecting a range that corresponds to the steady-state behavior (i.e., after the initial transient has passed) will give more accurate results, as it reflects the diffusion-controlled processes where the current decays predictably.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> values are not time intervals, but refer to the term
    <span class="equation">\(\frac{nFAC_0}{\sqrt{\pi} t^{1/2}}\)</span>, which includes time as a factor. You are selecting the range of this term for the regression analysis.</p>

    <h1 id="section_scan_rate">Scan rate to display (mV/s):</h1>
    <p>This option allows you to select the scan rate of interest for display in millivolts per second (mV/s). The scan rate determines how quickly the potential is swept during the experiment, which influences the current response in cyclic voltammetry or other electrochemical techniques.</p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <p>Selecting a specific scan rate will display the current-potential curve corresponding to that scan rate. For example, if you choose <strong>50 mV/s</strong>, the curve corresponding to a scan rate of 50 mV/s will be shown.</p>

<h1 id="section2">Smoothed/Smoothing Level (σ)</h1>

<h2>What is Smoothed/Smoothing Level (σ)?</h2>
<p>The term <strong>Smoothed/Smoothing Level (σ)</strong> refers to a parameter used in various data analysis and signal
    processing techniques to reduce noise and smooth out fluctuations in data. The smoothing level is often represented
    by the Greek letter <strong>σ</strong>, which indicates the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used in the
    smoothing process.</p>

<h2>Usage of Smoothing Level (σ)</h2>
<p>Smoothing is commonly applied in the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> To reveal underlying trends in data by reducing random fluctuations.</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Processing:</strong> To filter out high-frequency noise from signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> To blur images and reduce detail or noise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Smoothing Level (σ)</h2>
<p><strong>Choosing σ:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The value of σ determines the degree of smoothing. <strong>A larger σ results in more smoothing, while a smaller
        σ preserves more detail.</strong></li>
    <li>The appropriate σ value depends on the specific application and the nature of the data.</li>
    <li>The default value is often set to 10, but it should be adjusted based on the desired smoothing effect.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section9">Surface Area (A)</h1>

<h2>What is Surface Area?</h2>
<p>The <strong>surface area</strong>, denoted as \(A\), refers to the area of the electrode that is in contact with the
    electrolyte in an electrochemical cell. It is typically measured in square centimeters (cm²).</p>

<h1 id="section5">Tafel Analysis</h1>

<h2>What is Tafel Analysis?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tafel analysis</strong> is a method used in electrochemistry to determine the kinetics of an
    electrochemical reaction. It involves analyzing the Tafel plot, which is a plot of the logarithm of the current
    density (\(\log j\)) versus the overpotential (\(\eta\)). The Tafel equation describes the relationship between the
    overpotential and the current density, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and the rate-determining step.
</p>

<h2>Tafel Equation</h2>
<p>The Tafel equation for an anodic reaction is given by:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ \eta = a + b \log j $$
</div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>\(\eta\)</strong> = Overpotential (V)</li>
    <li><strong>\(j\)</strong> = Current density (A/cm²)</li>
    <li><strong>\(a\)</strong> = Tafel intercept (V)</li>
    <li><strong>\(b\)</strong> = Tafel slope (V/decade)</li>
</ul>

<p>For a cathodic reaction, the Tafel equation is:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ \eta = a - b \log j $$
</div>

<h2>Usage of Tafel Analysis</h2>
<p>Tafel analysis is commonly used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Determine the Tafel slope, which provides information about the rate-determining step of the reaction.</li>
    <li>Calculate the exchange current density, which is related to the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the efficiency of electrocatalysts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Tafel Analysis</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Perform Electrochemical Measurements:</strong> Conduct experiments to measure the current density
        (\(j\)) at various overpotentials (\(\eta\)).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Plot the Tafel Plot:</strong> Plot \(\eta\) versus \(\log j\) to obtain the Tafel plot.</li>
    <li><strong>Determine Tafel Parameters:</strong> From the linear region of the Tafel plot, determine the Tafel slope
        (\(b\)) and intercept (\(a\)).
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Example in Practice</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you perform electrochemical measurements for a reaction and obtain the following data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(j = 1\) mA/cm² at \(\eta = 0.1\) V</li>
    <li>\(j = 10\) mA/cm² at \(\eta = 0.2\) V</li>
    <li>\(j = 100\) mA/cm² at \(\eta = 0.3\) V</li>
</ul>

<p>Plotting \(\eta\) versus \(\log j\) yields a straight line. The Tafel slope (\(b\)) can be determined from the slope of this line, and the intercept (\(a\)) can be found from the y-intercept.</p>

    <h1 id="section_tafel">Tafel Analysis: Transfer Coefficient Calculation</h1>

    <h2>What is Tafel Analysis?</h2>
    <p>Tafel analysis is an electrochemical method used to determine the kinetics of electrochemical reactions by analyzing the relationship between overpotential and current density. It provides insights into how fast electron transfer occurs at the electrode surface, which is particularly useful for studying both anodic (oxidation) and cathodic (reduction) reactions.</p>

    <p>The Tafel equation is expressed as:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        \[\eta = a + b \log(i)\]
    </div>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\(\eta\) is the overpotential, the difference between the actual electrode potential and the equilibrium potential.</li>
        <li>\(a\) is a constant that depends on the electrode material and reaction conditions.</li>
        <li>\(b\) is the Tafel slope, which can be used to calculate the transfer coefficient.</li>
        <li>\(i\) is the current density.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tafel analysis enables the calculation of key parameters, such as the transfer coefficient (\(\alpha\)) and the exchange current density, which are essential for understanding the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions.</p>

    <h2>Calculation Method in This Software</h2>
    <p>In this software, Tafel analysis is employed to calculate the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients based on experimental data. This can be done using both non-mass-transport corrected and mass-transport corrected methods, depending on the specific conditions of the electrochemical system.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Non-Mass-Transport Corrected Method:</strong>
            <p>This method applies the classical Tafel analysis directly to the experimental data without accounting for the limitations caused by mass transport. The anodic (\(\alpha_a\)) and cathodic (\(\alpha_c\)) transfer coefficients are calculated using the following equations as defined by IUPAC:</p>
            <div class="equation">
                \[\alpha_a = \frac{RT}{F} \left( \frac{d \ln j_{a, \text{corr}}}{dE} \right)\]
            </div>
            <div class="equation">
                \[\alpha_c = -\frac{RT}{F} \left( \frac{d \ln |j_{c, \text{corr}}|}{dE} \right)\]
            </div>
            <p>where \( j_{a, \text{corr}} \) and \( j_{c, \text{corr}} \) are the anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively, corrected for experimental conditions.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mass-Transport Corrected Method:</strong>
            <p>This method accounts for the influence of mass transport on the electrochemical reaction, following the approach suggested by Danlei Li et al. (2018). The transfer coefficient is determined by:</p>
            <div class="equation">
                \[-\frac{d\ln \left( \frac{1}{I_a} - \frac{1}{I_{\text{peak}}} \right)}{d\theta} = \alpha_a'\]
            </div>
            <p>This method has also been employed in research, such as Bacil et al.'s study on dopamine oxidation at gold electrodes, demonstrating its wide applicability.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The software allows users to select between these two methods based on the experimental setup, providing flexibility and accurate analysis depending on whether or not mass transport effects need to be considered. By analyzing the Tafel slopes, users can gain valuable insights into the electron transfer kinetics of their system.</p>

    <h1 id="section_temperature">Temperature (T)</h1>
    <p>Temperature is just temperature, nothing to explain.</p>

    <h2>Conversions</h2>
    <p>If you need to convert between different temperature units, here are the relevant formulas:</p>

                \[
                T(K) = T(^\circ C) + 273.15
                \]
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>To convert Fahrenheit (&#8457;) to Celsius (&#8451;):

                \[
                T(^\circ C) = \frac{T(^\circ F) - 32}{1.8}
                \]
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>To convert Celsius (&#8451;) to Fahrenheit (&#8457;):
            <div class="equation">
                \[
                T(^\circ F) = T(^\circ C) \times 1.8 + 32
                \]
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h1 id="section_transfer">Transfer Coefficient (&#945;):</h1>
    <p>The transfer coefficient, denoted by &#945; (alpha), is a fundamental parameter in electrochemistry that describes the fraction of the electrical energy that contributes to the rate of an electrochemical reaction. It plays a key role in understanding the kinetics of electron transfer at the electrode surface.</p>

    <h2>What it represents:</h2>
    <p>&#945; quantifies the symmetry of the energy barrier for the forward and reverse reactions in an electrochemical system. It typically ranges between 0 and 1, where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&#945; = 0.5 indicates a symmetrical energy barrier, meaning the forward and reverse reactions are equally favored.</li>
        <li>&#945; &lt; 0.5 means that the reverse reaction is favored.</li>
        <li>&#945; &gt; 0.5 indicates that the forward reaction is favored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it's used:</h2>
    <p>The transfer coefficient is commonly used in the Butler-Volmer equation to describe the kinetics of electrochemical reactions. It helps determine the current-voltage relationship in the system, particularly under non-equilibrium conditions. A higher transfer coefficient can lead to faster reaction rates under an applied potential.</p>

    <h2>Tafel Analysis:</h2>
    <p>The transfer coefficient &#945; can also be obtained from Tafel analysis, which involves plotting the overpotential against the logarithm of the current density. The slope of the Tafel plot is directly related to the transfer coefficient and provides insights into the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction.</p>
